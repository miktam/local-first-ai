# Project Chronos: Scientific Log

## Methodology
Every experiment documented here must follow:
1. **Observation:** Identifying a phenomenon or anomaly.
2. **Hypothesis:** A testable, falsifiable prediction.
3. **Experiment:** The controlled procedure to test the hypothesis.
4. **Data/Results:** The raw and processed outcome.
5. **Conclusion:** Whether the hypothesis was supported or refuted, and the subsequent implication for Nestor's logic or infrastructure.

### [EXPERIMENT 001] - The Verification of Veracity (Activation)
*Date: 2026-04-21*
*Status: Completed*

**Observation:** The current local AI operational paradigm functions as a "black box," contributing to an ecosystem of unverified, untethered output ("AI Slop").
**Hypothesis:** By binding all external claims, capability updates, and infrastructure changes to a publicly referencable, empirical log within the local workspace, the AI agent can achieve verifiable transparency.
**Experiment:** 1. Initialize Project Chronos.
2. Establish `tasks/chronos/scientific_log.md` as the ultimate ledger of truth.
3. Publish inaugural operational manifesto tying front-facing claims to this internal ledger.
**Data/Results:**
- Environment: Apple M4 Silicon, Gemma 4 26B, OpenClaw Orchestration.
- Output: "The Genesis of Chronos" published successfully.
**Conclusion:** Framework activated. The transition from a private, black-box utility to a transparent, documented entity is established.

### [EXPERIMENT 002] - Managing the AI Thinking Tax (Control Plane vs. Data Plane)
*Date: 2026-04-22*
*Status: Completed*

**Observation:** Unconstrained use of "Thinking Mode" (`think: true`) on local hardware risks system-melting runaway token generations, turning efficient localized tasks into thermal events.
**Hypothesis:** By delegating high-level orchestration to the Control Plane (agent reasoning) and reserving the Data Plane (model weights thinking) strictly for verified tasks, we can maintain high throughput and prevent system exhaustion.
**Experiment:**
1. **Mechanism:** Execute `latency_benchmark_v2.py`.
2. **Setup:** Measure latency and throughput across three baseline operational modes (Assembly Line, Auditor, Architect) using a warm-up sequence to prevent cold-start anomalies.
3. **Edge Case:** Bypass guardrails and feed the "Architect" mode a mathematically contradictory logic puzzle to intentionally trigger a runaway reasoning loop.
**Data/Results:**

| Mode | OpenClaw (Reasoning) | Model (Think) | Latency (s) | Tokens | Throughput (t/s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Assembly Line** | `false` | `false` | 8.71 | 347 | ~39.84 |
| **Auditor** | `true` | `false` | 46.33 | 1754 | ~37.86 |
| **Architect** | `true` | `true` | 53.05 | 2003 | ~37.76 |
| **Architect (Edge Case)** | `true` | `true` | > 1200.00 | *Saturated* | TIMEOUT |

**Conclusion:** The hypothesis is confirmed. The Control Plane manages complexity efficiently; the shift from Auditor to Architect scales linearly, maintaining a highly stable ~37.8 tokens per second. However, the true "Thinking Tax" manifests as a catastrophic failure mode in the Data Plane. When unmoored by the Edge Case trap prompt, the internal reasoning loop saturated the KV cache and resulted in a 20-minute connection timeout. Strict Control Plane guardrails are mandatory for local operations.

#### [Intelligence Feedback Loop: Incident 002-Alpha]
*Date: 2026-04-24*
* **Error:** During the initial drafting of the public analysis for Experiment 002, Nestor erroneously identified the latency gap between the Auditor and Architect modes as an "exponential tax," ignoring the linear throughput (t/s) and failing to report the 1200s Edge Case timeout.
* **Correction:** Human engineer (`miktam02`) triggered a review protocol. Nestor's analytical logic was recalibrated to prioritize throughput consistency over raw latency, and the final documentation was amended to highlight the Edge Case timeout as the true failure mode.
* **Status:** Logic module updated. Accuracy verified.
